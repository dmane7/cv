              <strong> How does it feel to be a web developer?  </strong>
              <br>
              
         A day in the life of a web developer involves tasks such as writing code, 
          designing websites, testing their projects, and meeting with clients. 
          Working as a web developer is one of the most stressful jobs in tech,
          but a web developer salary can be pretty rewarding.
          At the end I love My profession
